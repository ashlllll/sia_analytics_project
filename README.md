# ✈️ Singapore Airlines Analytics System

**Enterprise-Style Python Application (Academic Project)**

---

## 🔎 Project Summary (For Recruiters)

This project demonstrates my ability to **design, coordinate, and deliver an enterprise-style Python system**, with emphasis on **system architecture, risk awareness, and cloud-ready design**, rather than isolated scripts or visual dashboards.

The system simulates how an airline could structure analytics applications to support **operational decision-making**, **risk modelling**, and **scalable processing**, using a clean modular architecture and shared service layers.

> ⚠️ **Important note:**
> All data used in this project is **synthetic** and created strictly for **academic demonstration purposes**.
> No real Singapore Airlines operational data is used.

## 👩‍💻 My Role (Team Leader)

As **Team Leader**, I was responsible for the **overall technical direction and system integration** of the project.

My contributions included:

* Designing the **overall system architecture** (dashboard, analytics modules, shared services)
* Developing the **main dashboard interface and CLI entry point**
* Coordinating integration across multiple independently developed modules
* Managing **GitHub version control workflow** and **Streamlit Cloud deployment**
* Ensuring consistency in structure, documentation, and enterprise-style design principles

This role reflects how I approach real-world systems: **clear structure, modular thinking, risk awareness, and ownership**.

## 🧱 What This Project Demonstrates

From a professional and hiring perspective, this project showcases:

### ✅ Enterprise Python System Design

* Modular application structure
* Clear separation of concerns (`dashboard`, `pages`, `services`)
* Shared utility layers for data access and UI consistency

### ✅ Risk-Aware & Governance-Oriented Thinking

* Explicit modelling of uncertainty using **Monte Carlo simulation**
* Clear documentation of assumptions and limitations
* Dedicated consideration of **security, privacy, and ethical implications**

### ✅ Cloud & Deployment Readiness

* Web-based deployment using **Streamlit**
* Secondary **CLI mode** for non-visual or lightweight execution
* Cloud deployment via **GitHub + Streamlit Cloud**

### ✅ Applied Analytics (Beyond Visualisation)

* Decision-support focus rather than reporting-only dashboards
* Scenario modelling and resilience analysis
* Batch and near–real-time processing concepts

## ⚙️ System Modules 

The system is composed of **six coordinated modules**, covering both **analytics functionality** and **enterprise-level governance considerations**.

### **1️⃣ Flight Performance Analytics**

Analysis of operational flight patterns, including distance distributions, delay trends, and **simulated fuel consumption** using distance-based estimation models.

### **2️⃣ Customer Experience Analytics**

Evaluation of passenger satisfaction metrics and service quality indicators to support customer-centric performance improvement.

### **3️⃣ Risk & Scenario Simulation**

Monte Carlo–based simulation to model operational uncertainty, delay escalation, and disruption scenarios, enabling **risk-aware decision-making**.

### **4️⃣ Cloud Analytics**

Demonstration of cloud-oriented analytics concepts, including batch-style processing, lightweight streaming simulation, and scalable data handling patterns.

---

### **5️⃣ System Overview & Architecture**

A dedicated module documenting the **overall system architecture**, including:

* Modular application layout
* Separation of dashboard, services, and analytics modules
* Architectural rationale aligned with enterprise application principles

This module highlights **system-level thinking beyond individual features**.

---

### **6️⃣ Security, Risk & Ethical Considerations**

A governance-focused module addressing:

* Data privacy and ethical use of analytics
* Security considerations in decision-support systems
* Risks associated with synthetic data and simulated metrics
* Responsible interpretation of analytics outputs

This module reflects **security-aware and risk-conscious design**, rather than purely functional implementation.

---

## ▶️ Quick Run (Optional Technical Review)

### Streamlit Web Interface

```bash
streamlit run Dashboard.py
```

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
python3 Dashboard.py cli
```

The CLI mode provides numerical summaries and menu-driven navigation, demonstrating enterprise-style non-visual system access.
